				<h1>Personal Information</h1>
				<p>I was born in Hobart, Tasmania and still reside here today, but I have plenty of family spread out over Australia particularly Perth, Western Australia.</p>
				<p>Programming has been a passion of mine for many years. While most of my knowledge of programming is self-taught, I did complete various computing subjects through my final years of high school and college (year 11 & 12) and I completed the first year of the Bachelor of ICT at the University of Tasmania.</p>
				<p>Programming is my main hobby and I’m pretty nerdy in general, but also have interests outside of computing, for example I also enjoy competitive powerlifting and training at the gym.</p>

				<h1>Interest in IT</h1>
				<p>While I do find many areas of technology fascinating, I am particularly drawn towards applications development and algorithms.
				Many of my past personal projects revolved around learning concepts such as A* pathfinding and implementing them in small game projects in unity, but more recently I have been enjoying working with small scale electronics such as Arduino and learning lower-level coding with C++. </p>
				<p>My interest in ICT started at a very early age. As a kid I was always messing with the family computer to try and learn how things worked on it.
				As I got older and started to play video games this turned into a fascination with the idea of making my own games and getting into programming in general.</p>
				<p>I didn’t have the best experience with Utas and dropped out of my degree, but after some years of self-taught programming I managed to land a job at DXC Technologies.
				Through DXC I have spent the last two and a half years working as a technical consultant developing enterprise platform solutions for large companies. The job various from project to project but is mostly integration work, developing platforms and API’s that interact with databases or even just customising CRM systems.</p>
				<p>My desire to come and study at RMIT is motivated by a few factors. While it’s never bothered the big bosses at DXC that I am self-taught, I cannot guarantee that other companies will feel the same way. I feel as though finishing my degree will help legitimise my skills as well as build on them as fill any gaps in my knowledge.</p>
				<p>I hope to further my skills when it comes to the lower-level aspects of programming; for example, learning patterns and best practices for memory management in C/C++ applications for performance. </p>

				<h1>Ideal Job</h1>
				<p>If I were to perfectly describe my ideal job, it would be in a position where I am working on some kind of innovative technology; I really like the idea of working on a product rather than simply being contracted to build some kind of webpage that at its essence, is just an advanced CRUD application implementing business rules.</p>

				<p>The job application above is for a company that specialises in self-driving vehicle AI. They appear to be interested in developing affordable high-end general-purpose vehicle AI that any auto manufacturer could make use of. 
				This application particularly appeals to me when reading its ‘The Role’ section as it describes building custom code to run on custom hardware where code performance/OS development are the main focus.
				Lately these are actually subjects I have been fascinated by and has been the main focus of many of my latest hobby projects.</p>
				<p>For a job like this not only would it be essential to have a clear understanding of how hardware works and how software makes use of it, but also how the architectural design of these two aspects can impact the overall performance of the system.</p>
				<p>My current skillset is predominantly in C# and the .NET framework with a touch of SQL a little bit of web dev. 
				This is all pretty high level as I never need to be concerned with things like memory management or even the hardware that my code is running on.
				In general my understanding of electronics and computer hardware at a deep level is pretty lacking and is something I am trying to work on.</p>
				<p>For me to build up the skills to achieve this kind of work I definitely need to become more versed in the maths involved with Computer Science. This is actually one of my reasons for returning to university.</p>

				<h1>Profile</h1>
				<ul>
					<li>Myers-Briggs Test: Turbulent Mediator (INFP-T)</li>
					<li>Learning Style: Visual</li>
				</ul>
				<p>I’m not overly surprised by the results of the learning styles test as I already knew that I have a more visual learning style.
				When it comes to learning or understanding important information, I find it quite hard to keep track of all the details when being told verbally and I usually prefer to simply read resources for myself that to have them read out to me, and having diagrams is often essential for me to completely grasp a complex idea.
				and while the results of the Myer-Briggs test didn’t describe me 100% perfectly, it still had a scary level of accuracy. I found this test particularly enjoyable as I have an uncommon classification and its comforting to know there are more people out there with personality traits that match my own.</p>
				<p>I don’t think knowing the results of the test will particularly influence my behaviours in a team, but it certainly helps understand how I can improve in areas where things aren’t working perfectly or where I am struggling to understand what to do next.</p>
