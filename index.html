				<h1>Personal Information</h1>
				<p>Name: Kristian Vines<br/>Student Number: S3975623<br/>Email: S3975623@student.rmit.edu.au</p>
				<p>About Me:<br/>My name is Kristian Vines and I’m from Hobart Tasmania.</p>
				<p>Programming has been a passion of mine for many years now and I consider it to be one of my main hobbies. Most of my knowledge at this point is self-taught through 
				   personal projects, although I did spend some time in a Bachelor of ICT at the University of Tasmania. I didn’t complete the degree and I am hoping to return to my 
				   studies and complete a Bachelor of IT through RMIT online.</p>
				<p>My favourite foods are typically Italian or Asian dishes, particularly Pizza, Vietnamese Pho or any sort of spicy noodle soup.</p>
				<p>Outside of technology my next biggest passion would be powerlifting. It’s a sport I have been doing since early 2016. I did take some time off for a while due to 
				   injuries, but after a full recovery I am back at it again and hoping to maybe compete again one day.</p>

				<h1>Interest in IT</h1>
				<p>My interest in ICT started at a very early age. For example; as a kid I was always messing with the family computer to try and learn how things worked. From day one 
				   I always knew I wanted to work with computers.<br/>As I got older, I started to play video games and this kick started a full-on fascination with the idea of making
				   my own video games and getting into software development as a career.<br/>I have followed this passion for many years and after a lot of hard work I have now started 
				   my career at DXC Technologies as a Technical Consultant. Through DXC I have spent the last two and a half years as a consultant developing enterprise platform 
				   solutions for other companies and some government bodies including Skills Tasmania and the Department of Education. The job various from project to project but is 
				   mostly integration work, asp.net applications or anything that typically revolves around the many Microsoft technologies such as SharePoint, CRM or the Azure.</p>
				<p>My desire to come and study at RMIT is motivated by a few factors.<br/>It’s never bothered the big bosses at DXC that I am self-taught, but the reality is that I 
				   cannot guarantee other companies will feel the same way.<br/>I feel as though finishing my degree through OUA & RMIT Online will help legitimise my skills as well 
				   as build on them and fill any gaps in my knowledge.</p>
				<p>I expect that I will learn many new skills while studying, but one desire I have is to further my skills when it comes to the lower-level aspects of programming;
				   for example, learning patterns and best practices for memory management in C/C++ applications for performance.</p>

				<h1>Ideal Job</h1>
				<p>If I were to perfectly describe my ideal job, it would be in a position where I am working on some kind of innovative technology; I really like the idea of working
				   on a product rather than simply being contracted to build a series of webpages that at their essence are just advanced CRUD applications that implement business 
				   rules.</p>

				<p>The job application above is for a company that specialises in self-driving vehicle AI. They appear to be interested in developing affordable high-end general-purpose
				   vehicle AI that any auto manufacturer could make use of.<br/>This application particularly appeals to me when reading its ‘The Role’ section as it describes building
				   custom code to run on custom hardware where code performance/OS development are the main focus.<br/>Lately these are actually subjects I have been fascinated by and
				   have been the main focus of many of my recent hobby projects.</p>
				<p>For a job like this not only would it be essential to have a clear understanding of how hardware works and how software makes use of it, but also how the 
				   architectural design of these two aspects can impact the overall performance of the system.</p>
				<p>My current skillset is predominantly in C# and the .NET framework with a touch of SQL and a little bit of web dev although I have minor experience with other 
				   technologies such as Angular and React, Azure Function apps, F# and CRM systems to name a few.</p>
				<p>These skills are considered pretty high level and in general my understanding of the lower-level side of things like electronics and computer hardware at a deep 
				   level is pretty lacking and is something I am trying to work on. For me to build up the skills to achieve this kind of work I definitely need to become more versed 
				   in the maths involved with Computer Science.<br/>This is one of my primary reasons for returning to university.</p>

				<h1>Profile</h1>

					<li>Myers-Briggs Test: Turbulent Mediator (INFP-T)</li>
					<li>Learning Style: Visual</li>
					<li>ARealMe.com EQ test: 120/200</li>
				</ul>
				<p>I’m not overly surprised by the results of the learning styles test as I already knew that I have a more visual learning style.<br/>When it comes to learning or 
				   understanding important information, I find it quite hard to keep track of all the details when being told verbally and I usually prefer to simply read resources 
				   for myself that to have them read out to me, and having diagrams is often essential for me to completely grasp a complex idea.</p>
				<p>I really enjoyed the Myer-Briggs test. It is one I have completed in the past but it was interesting to experience it again. Like many of these tests it didn’t 
				   describe me 100% perfectly, but it’s quire fascinating the level of accuracy it had. Part of the reason I find it particularly enjoyable is that I have a less common
				   classification and its comforting to read something that sums me up so accurately.</p>
				<p>I don’t think knowing the results of the test will particularly influence my behaviours in a team as I already have lots of experience with team work in my current
				   job. I will say though that it certainly does help to understand what I can do to improve in areas where things aren’t working perfectly or in areas where I am 
				   struggling.</p>

				<h1>Project Idea - Barbell Motion Tracking App</h1>
				
				<h4>Overview</h4>
				<p>My idea is to create a mobile app that uses the phones inbuilt camera to watch you while you do compound lifts such as squats, bench-press or deadlifts.</p>
				<p>In powerlifting, we often refer to lifts using a scale of difficulty called RPE (rating of perceived effort) where zero would be us at rest, 5 might be something that
				   is somewhat difficult to lift, 7 being rather difficult, 9 being very difficult and 10 being our absolute maximum weight lift.</p>
				<p>This is a scale that goes by feel, but it can also be interpreted with ease by a third party based on how fast the bar moves from the top of the lift to the bottom, 
				   then back up again. For example: If a squat with average weight takes 1 second down then 1.5 seconds up, but a very heavy lift takes 1 second down and 3 seconds up  
				   and comes close to stopping before the top, it would arguably be an RPE 9-10 lift.</p>
				<p>This system works pretty well to get an idea of how difficult a training plan is, but provides no real data that can be analysed for real insight into your  
				   performance.</p>
				<p>This app would use real time image recognition software to find the centre of mass of the barbell from a side perspective and then track and graph the motion of the  
				   bar over time, storing and later comparing the data from many individual lifts over many weeks. The user would only need to specify which lift is being performed and  
				   at what weight.</p>
				
				<h4>Motivation</h4>
				<p>Powerlifting is a passion of mine and the idea of using technology to help with my performance is something that really fascinates me. I regularly take personal  
				   training sessions with my coach to increase my strength and most of our performance over time is tracked by doing a session of max lifts, then training over several  
				   weeks and later doing more max lifts and comparing them.</p>
				<p>The trouble with this is that I very much rely on my coach. When I train at the gym without him there, he relies on my ability to track what RPE my heaviest lifts  
				   were to gauge how much to increase my weight week by week.</p>
				
				<h4>Description</h4>
				<p>A new user would create an account where they input statistics such as their weight and height and what their current max squat, bench-press and deadlift lifts are.  
				   From there they would input a workout plan which includes some of these compound lifts.</p>
				<p>Each time the user goes to the gym, they clip their phone into a stand and open up the app. They would select their workout plan, select the day of the workout they  
				   will be completing and get started.<br/>As they progress through the lifts they will click record on the app, go to the rack and perform the lift, then click end  
				   recording.</p>
				<p>Each lift will provide real time statistics on the travel path of the bar, the speed, the timing and whether your upward motion stopped at all along the way. This  
				   would be done with each consecutive lift, and at the end this data would be stored as a set for that particular day. Users might even be interested in reporting  
				   whether they were feeling energised or maybe sluggish that day to indicate to the app that they weren’t at peak performance. This is something we take into account  
				   with our RPE evaluation of a lift.</p>
				<p>Once the user has completed many days’ worth of this with each of the compound movements the app would provide many forms of graphs and statistical analysis to  
				   provide the user with insight into their current performance and maybe even tips on what they need to focus on and what is progressing well.</p>
				
				<h4>Tools and Technologies</h4>
				<p>The implementation could be as simple as an app with local storage, but servers with databases should be strongly considered as the majority of users will wish to  
				   share their stats with friends or user their same account across multiple devices. </p>
				<p>Xamarin is a great example of a framework that could be used to create an app that would be compatible with both Android and apple devices. It’s a reliable product  
				   provided by Microsoft and leverages .Net and C# which are very common and easy to learn programming languages.</p>
				<p>The image tracking can likely leverage an online service initially while the app is in development but later on it would be ideal to write our own image tracking  
				   software that can run locally on each device.</p>

				<h4>Skills Required</h4>
				<p>Skills required would include Xamarin and .Net Framework development in C# for the mobile app.<br/>An understanding of how to write API’s backed by databases in SQL 
				   will be required for the cloud/backend aspects of the project.</p>
				<p>I am quite familiar with the .Net Framework in C# as well as SQL so these would be ideal technologies for me to make use of.</p>

				<h4>Outcome</h4>
				<p>This project will hopefully allow coaches and athletes to take a more data driven approach with benefits spanning many areas from strength gains to safety lifting 
				   technique.</p>
